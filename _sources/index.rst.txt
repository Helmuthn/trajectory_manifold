Trajectory Manifold
===============================================

This is a Python library for doing statistics on the manifold of trajectories
implicitly defined by a differential equation.

.. note::

   This project is under active development for an anticipated paper submission.

The key feature of this library is the ability to push densities
through the implicit transformation between the state space of the system
and the trajectory manifold.

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

Installation is to come later. This code will eventually be turned into a 
package to be installed with pip.

Quick Start 
-----------

Trajectory estimation over any finite time-horizon is a reparameterization
of the state estimation problem for a system.
Thus, the only change to classical estimation methods is to incorporate the
reparameterization to the objective function.

The key function in the library is ``manifold.system_pushforward_weight``.

.. autofunction:: trajectory_manifold.manifold.system_pushforward_weight

Given a description of the dynamics and forecasting objective, this function
constructs the associated reweighting for a given point.
