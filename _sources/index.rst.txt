Trajectory Manifold Documentation!
===============================================

This is a Python library for doing statistics on the manifold of trajectories
implicitly defined by a differential equation.

.. note::

   This project is under active development for an anticipated paper submission.

The key feature of this library is the ability to push densities
through the implicit transformation between the state space of the system
and the trajectory manifold.
